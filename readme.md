# My First Website - Learning Journey

## Project Overview
This is my very first web development project.
It includes:
- **HTML**: basic structure, hero section, heading, paragraph
- **CSS**: styling for text, layout, colors, alignment
- **Javascript**: interactive button with alert message

## Features
- Hero section with heading and introductory paragraph
- Button that shows an alert message: "Hello, welcome to my page!"
- Basic responsive styling

## Learning Milestones
1. Learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
2. Practiced linking JS and CSS files to HTML
3. Understood how to structure a simple website project
4. Gained experience using Github to version control the project

## Troubleshooting Moment
During this project, I faced a **challenging issue with Github Desktop**:
- Encountered **duplicate folders and .git conflicts** when linking the local repository to Github website
- I analyzed the problem, cleaned up folders, and successfully connected my desktop repository to the Github website
- This moment taught me **problem-solving, perseverance, and independence** as a beginner

## Next Steps
- Continue adding new sections and improving UI/UX
- Practice updating JS and CSS for interactive features
- Track progress in commit history for portfolio showcase
- Document future milestones and learning experiences in this README
