2. Practiced linking JS and CSS files to HTML
3. Understood how to structure a simple website project
4. Gained experience using Github to version control the project

## Troubleshooting Moment
During this project, I faced a **challenging issue with Github Desktop**:
- Encountered **duplicate folders and .git conflicts** when linking the local repository to Github website
- I analyzed the problem, cleaned up folders, and successfully connected my desktop repository to the Github website
- This moment taught me **problem-solving, perseverance, and independence** as a beginner

## Next Steps

## Latest Updates

Date: 21/11/2025 2.10AM

**Navbar & Menu Bar**
- Added **menu container** with **rounded edges** for better aesthetics.
- Menu links (Home | Projects | Contacts) are now **centered inside the container** while the container sits on the left side of the navbar.
- Adjusted **padding and border radius** for a sleeker, more balanced look.
- Experimented with **hover effects** and spacing for proper alignment.

**Body Background Color Experiments**
- Changed body background color multiple times to find the right soft tone:
    - Started with #ffffff (white) -> too plain.
    - Tried #f3e9df -> looked slightly purple-ish.
    - Tested #f7e396 -> too yellow.
    - Tested #f3e29d -> a bit orange-ish.
    - Tried #fffde7 -> its not a yellow color.
    - Tried another color #fff59e, and its not a soft yellow.
    - Final (for now) #faf4bb -> looks youtful, still a bit off from the ideal color.
- Learned about **CSS vs inline HTML priority** and how changes reflect on the live website.
- Recognized the importance of patience--sometimes the site needs a few minutes to update after pushing changes.

**Styling Tweaks**
- Navbar color updated to **match the body background** for a seamless design.
- Commented out necessary top bar text to simplify the header.

**Summary of Learning Points**
- CSS **container alignment** vs content alignment--menu container placement vs menu links centering.
- Iterative design: adjusting padding, border-radius, spacing, and colors until visual balance is achieved.
- Body background color experimentation teaches patience, attention to detail, and testing multiple options.
- The importance of **commits with precise summary and description** to track workflow and progress.
