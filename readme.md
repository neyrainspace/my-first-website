# My First Website - Learning Journey

## Project Overview
This is my very first web development project.
It includes:
- **HTML**: basic structure, hero section, heading, paragraph
- **CSS**: styling for text, layout, colors, alignment
- **Javascript**: interactive button with alert message

## Features
- Hero section with heading and introductory paragraph
- Button that shows an alert message: "Hello, welcome to my page!"
- Basic responsive styling

## Learning Milestones
1. Learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
2. Practiced linking JS and CSS files to HTML
3. Understood how to structure a simple website project
4. Gained experience using Github to version control the project

## Troubleshooting Moment
During this project, I faced a **challenging issue with Github Desktop**:
- Encountered **duplicate folders and .git conflicts** when linking the local repository to Github website
- I analyzed the problem, cleaned up folders, and successfully connected my desktop repository to the Github website
- This moment taught me **problem-solving, perseverance, and independence** as a beginner

## Next Steps
- Continue adding new sections and improving UI/UX
- Practice updating JS and CSS for interactive features
- Track progress in commit history for portfolio showcase
- Document future milestones and learning experiences in this README

## Latest Updates

Date: 21/11/2025 2.10AM

**Navbar & Menu Bar**
- Added **menu container** with **rounded edges** for better aesthetics.
- Menu links (Home | Projects | Contacts) are now **centered inside the container** while the container sits on the left side of the navbar.
- Adjusted **padding and border radius** for a sleeker, more balanced look.
- Experimented with **hover effects** and spacing for proper alignment.

**Body Background Color Experiments**
- Changed body background color multiple times to find the right soft tone:
    - Started with #ffffff (white) -> too plain.
    - Tried #f3e9df -> looked slightly purple-ish.
    - Tested #f7e396 -> too yellow.
    - Tested #f3e29d -> a bit orange-ish.
    - Tried #fffde7 -> its not a yellow color.
    - Tried another color #fff59e, and its not a soft yellow.
    - Final (for now) #faf4bb -> looks youtful, still a bit off from the ideal color.
- Learned about **CSS vs inline HTML priority** and how changes reflect on the live website.
- Recognized the importance of patience--sometimes the site needs a few minutes to update after pushing changes.

**Styling Tweaks**
- Navbar color updated to **match the body background** for a seamless design.
- Commented out necessary top bar text to simplify the header.

**Summary of Learning Points**
- CSS **container alignment** vs content alignment--menu container placement vs menu links centering.
- Iterative design: adjusting padding, border-radius, spacing, and colors until visual balance is achieved.
- Body background color experimentation teaches patience, attention to detail, and testing multiple options.
- The importance of **commits with precise summary and description** to track workflow and progress.

## Updates: My HTML Learning Journey

Date: 23/11/2025 3.24AM

This is all about **my process of learning HTML** while working on my first website project.

**My Approach**
- I dont just copy code or memorize instructions. I like to **write notes in my own words,** explain concepts to myself, and then **ask questions to validate** if I really understand. For me, it's important to know **why something works,** not just how to type it.

**How I Learn**
1. **Self-explaining**
    - I write everything in my own language, even if it's a little messy. I treat my notes like im teaching myself out loud.
2. **Validation**
    - After writing my understanding, I check it -- ask questions or   get feedback. This confirms that I really get it.
3. **Section-by-section**
    - I focus on one section of the page at a time. It helps me track progress, build muscle memory, and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
4. **Tools exposure first**
    - I started my first project even when I didn't fully understand HTML or CSS. The goal was to **get familiar with VS Code, Github, and Github Pages** -- just learning the workflow.

**What I've Learned So Far**
- How to structure HTML: <section>, <div>, <nav>, classes, IDs.
- Difference between **block and inline elements**
- Using **alt for images** for accessibility.
- When to use **CSS vs inline styling**
- How to use **anchor links** and buttons.
- Importance of **comments** to organize my code.

**Reflections**
- My first project isn't perfect -- I make mistakes, but that's part of the process.
- Im building confidence step by step, and my **muscle memory is growing.**
- Focusing on understanding **before styling or scripting** makes coding feel less overwhelming.
- This journey is about learning **how to think like a developer,** not just writing code.

**Next Steps**
- **CSS** -> Start styling each section: top bar, hero, text, buttons, colors, spacing.
- **Refactor HTML** -> Clean current structure, ensure proper classes & IDs, prepare for styling.
- **JS** -> Add interactivity: button clicks, alerts, DOM manipulation, anchor link smooth scroll.
- **Project Workflow** -> Section-by-section implementation, testing, and Github updates.
- **Reflection** -> Track progress, document learning in README, and gradually improve UI & UX.
